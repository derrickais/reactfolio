            <p>
                Hello! I'm Derricka. I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at Rutgers 
                University. Although I don't have an extensive coding background, I did do AP 
                and Honors Computer Science in High School as well as a couple of Computer Science
                related courses at Hunter College. It was something I enjoyed doing as a hobby and found
                quite amusing once I got the hang of things.

                In the last two years since high school, I was working on my bachelor's degree in Chemistry.
                At the beginning of my junior year, I had to have surgery on my left knee; a surgery that 
                ultimately left me with 8 screws in my femur and no meniscus. I was now unable to stand
                in a lab for hours at a time, a skill that is necessary in most Chemistry related careers. 
                I decided to rekindle my long lost love and start coding again. Like most folks, my path into 
                the coding world was an unexpected one but I am definitely glad to be here.
